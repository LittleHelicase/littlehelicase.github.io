Hello, my name is Maximilian Klein and this blog is about 
interactive design techniques. Me and my pal 
[Hastebrot](http://hastebrot.github.io/) want to discuss new ideas
and apps that demonstrate how you can use interactive tools. 

This Blog is build with Metalsmith with the help of 
[Robin Thrift's nice Metalsmith Tutorial](http://www.robinthrift.com/posts/metalsmith-part-1-setting-up-the-forge/).
