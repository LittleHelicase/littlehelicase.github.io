Over the last few years a few colleges of me and looked at software development
in general. How it is done and what problems arise in almost all projects. We
looked at lots of programming languages and frameworks to understand the problems
of programming.

Buggy is a development platform that tries a new approach. Programming should 
become more about achieving a goal and less about struggling with details.

Over the next weeks I will show different the ideas Buggy is built on. I want
to talk about the benefits of using Buggy and about completely new ways of
programming.

In my next post I want to introduce the unique way of abstracting things in
Buggy which makes it really powerful.
