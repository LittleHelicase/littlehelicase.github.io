                <article><p>I recently discovered <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> a new web 
framework that utilizes the Web Components technology in a very neat way.
Polymer helps you create new Web Components in a very intuitive, descriptive
an simple fashion. And the best thing about it is that the Web Components
technology doesn&#39;t rely on polymer, you can simply create a component that
interacts with other Web Components created with e.g. <a href="http://www.x-tags.org/">x-Tags</a>.</p></article>

                <article><p>Abstraction is a key concept in managing complexity. But creating good abstractions
is hard. Often abstractions try to hide complexity but fail to improve usability.
It is very important to not introduce new complexity by abstractions.</p></article>

                <article><p>Over the last few years a few colleges of me and looked at software development
in general. How it is done and what problems arise in almost all projects. We
looked at lots of programming languages and frameworks to try to understand the problems
of programming.</p></article>

                <article><p>A few days ago I talked with <a href="http://hastebrot.github.io/">Hastebrot</a> about
user interfaces and we tried to figure out why some applications are more 
popular than other, even though they aren&#39;t always the best application.</p></article>
